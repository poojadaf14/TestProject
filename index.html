    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <h2>Test</h2>
    <p>im learning full stack javascript</p>
    
</div>
 <p> first i have started with html then css
    in html i learn so many things like how to creat forms and many more things.
    in css i learn how to give styles to my html files.  there are so many thing that we can add like color,background color, shadow, font-size how to add images like that... </p>
    these are the basics that we all know. 
    after that, i'm going to learn javascript.
    javasript is totally different from java.
    here we learn javascript.
    but before going to javasript we're going through the tailwind. 
    we go thrugh the tailwind docs and how it works.
    i learn markdown.
    and the journey of javascript is started.
